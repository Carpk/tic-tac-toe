# Tic-Tac-Toe

Command line game, only Ruby needs to be installed. Currently, there are 3 differant versions. Each on a seperate branch.

#### Master

The first working version, the computer AI starts on the same spot at the beginning of each game every time. 

#### Master_refactor

The same logic as Master, but some refactoring where the strategies are broken down after 1 of the initial 5 are choosen.

#### Rand_start

The first version of the game, which set the foundation on how the logic would be implemented. Each strategy will have a separate file. And the computer AI will choose a random starting point from certain key positions, on the board at each game start.
