# Tic-Tac-Toe

Command line game, only Ruby needs to be installed. Currently, there are 3 differant versions. Each on a seperate branch.

#### Master

Turning the command line game version from master_original to a full web app.

#### Master_original (completed)

The first working version, the computer AI starts on the same spot at the beginning of each game every time.

#### Rand_start

The first version of the game, which set the foundation on how the logic would be implemented. Each strategy will have a separate file. And the computer AI will choose a random starting point from certain key positions, on the board at each game start.

## Getting Started

Download master_original branch, and run:

`ruby ttt.rb`
